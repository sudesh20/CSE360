# CSE360
This program implements a standalone Java application (HW2) to manage a question-and-answer system with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The system consists of four main classes:

Question Class – Represents an individual question with attributes such as questionID, content, author, timestamp, and a list of associated answers. It includes methods to create, update, and delete questions.
Answer Class – Represents an answer linked to a specific question, containing attributes like answerID, questionID, content, author, and timestamp. It includes methods to modify and delete answers.
QuestionsList Class – Manages a collection of Question objects, providing methods to add, retrieve, update, and delete questions.
AnswersList Class – Manages a collection of Answer objects, supporting the addition, retrieval, updating, and deletion of answers.
The HW2 (Main Class) facilitates user interactions via a console-based interface, enabling users to create and manage questions and answers while enforcing input validation. The program also supports user authentication and role selection.

Comprehensive unit tests are included to verify CRUD operations and input validation, ensuring data integrity. The implementation follows test-driven development (TDD) principles, and UML diagrams document the system architecture.
